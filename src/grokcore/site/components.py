    Although application developers can create local utilies without
    actually subclassing `grokcore.site.LocalUtility`, they gain three
    benefits from doing so.  First, their code is more readable
    because their classes "look like" local utilities to casual
    readers.  Second, their utility will know how to persist itself to
    the Zope database, which means that they can set its object
    attributes and know that the values are getting automatically
    saved.  Third, they can omit the `grok.provides()` directive
    naming the interface that the utility provides, if their class
    only `grok.implements()` a single interface (unless the interface
    is one that the `grok.LocalUtility` already implements, in which
    case Grok cannot tell them apart, and `grok.provides()` must be
    used explicitly anyway).
