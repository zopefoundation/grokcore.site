"""
Subclassed sites inherit all local utilities of their base classes:

  >>> cave = BigCave()
  >>> getRootFolder()["cave"] = cave

  >>> from zope import component
  >>> from zope.component.hooks import getSite, setSite

  >>> setSite(cave)
  >>> fireplace = component.getUtility(IFireplace)
  >>> IFireplace.providedBy(fireplace)
  True
  >>> isinstance(fireplace, Fireplace)
  True

Additional utilities can be registered in the subclass:

  >>> hollow = HollowCave()
  >>> getRootFolder()["hollow"] = hollow

  >>> setSite(hollow)
  >>> fireplace = component.getUtility(IFireplace)
  >>> IFireplace.providedBy(fireplace)
  True
  >>> isinstance(fireplace, Fireplace)
  True

  >>> painting = component.getUtility(IPainting)
  >>> IPainting.providedBy(painting)
  True
  >>> isinstance(painting, Painting)
  True

Those do not influence the base class:

  >>> setSite(cave)
  >>> painting = component.getUtility(IPainting)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  zope.interface.interfaces.ComponentLookupError: (<InterfaceClass grokcore.site.tests.functional.utility.subclass.IPainting>, '')

This works various levels of inheritance deep:

  >>> very_hollow = VeryHollowCave()
  >>> getRootFolder()['very_hollow'] = very_hollow

  >>> setSite(very_hollow)
  >>> fireplace = component.getUtility(IFireplace)
  >>> painting = component.getUtility(IPainting)
  >>> great_painting = component.getUtility(IPainting, 'great')
  >>> bad_painting = component.getUtility(IPainting, 'bad')

And with inheritance hierarchies where a base class is inherited multiple
times through different routes:

  >>> scary = ScaryCave()
  >>> getRootFolder()['scary'] = scary

  >>> setSite(scary)
  >>> fireplace = component.getUtility(IFireplace)
  >>> painting = component.getUtility(IPainting)
  >>> great_painting = component.getUtility(IPainting, 'great')
  >>> bad_painting = component.getUtility(IPainting, 'bad')
