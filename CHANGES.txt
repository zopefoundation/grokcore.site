1.2 (2009-12-20)
----------------

* Migrated imports from zope.app.component to zope.site.

1.1 (2009-09-18)
----------------

* Updated dependencies (added missing ones and added separate test
  dependencies).

* A local utility now implements IAttributeAnnotatable.

* Update code documentation from Grok itself.

* Use 1.0b2 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
  copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
  maintain.

------------------

* Reupload to pypi with a correct version of Python which doesn't have
  a distutils bug.

1.0 (2009-06-29)

  grokkers and directives out of Grok.
