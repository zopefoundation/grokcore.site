----------------

* Migrated imports from zope.app.component to zope.site.

1.1 (2009-09-18)
----------------

  dependencies).

* A local utility now implements IAttributeAnnotatable.

* Update code documentation from Grok itself.

* Use 1.0b2 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local

  maintain.
